# Two-Stage OTA Design (TSMC180nm CMOS, LTspice)  
**Author:** Spandan (ID: 230102108)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Design a two-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) using **TSMC 180nm technology** with the following specifications:

- OTA should be used in a **non-inverting amplifier** configuration with a **closed-loop gain of 2**.
- The **open-loop DC gain** of the OTA must be **at least 40 dB**.
- The amplifier must be **stable**, with a **phase margin of approximately 60°**.
- The design should respond properly to a **0.2 V step input**.

All simulations are performed in **LTspice**, and manual calculations were used for designing transistor widths, lengths, compensation, and other key analog parameters.
